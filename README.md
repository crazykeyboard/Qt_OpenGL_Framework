Qt_OpenGL_Framework
===================

I develop this framework for loading .ply models, now it can rendering the model in different modes. In this project I implemented smooth movement of the model, I like it very much. Hope it will be useful to you.

You can run this project on windows with VS2008 + Qt + OpenGL
